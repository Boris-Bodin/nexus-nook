# 9. Data Validation

Date: 2024-01-19

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need a data validation library for our project that allows us to validate data at runtime. The library should be easy to use, have a large community, and be well-documented.

## Decision

We have decided to use Zod for data validation.

Zod is a TypeScript-first schema declaration and validation library. It provides a way to create schemas that can be used to validate JavaScript and TypeScript data at runtime.

## Reasons

1. **TypeScript-First**: Zod is designed with TypeScript in mind. It provides a way to derive static types from our schemas, ensuring that our validation logic is always in sync with our types.

2. **Ease of Use**: Zod provides a simple and intuitive API for defining schemas and validating data.

3. **Custom Validation**: Zod allows us to define custom validation logic, giving us the flexibility to handle complex validation scenarios.

4. **Error Handling**: Zod provides detailed error objects when validation fails, making it easier to debug and handle validation errors.

## Consequences

1. **Runtime Overhead**: Zod performs validation at runtime, which can add some overhead to our application. However, this is usually offset by the benefits of catching invalid data early.
